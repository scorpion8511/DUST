## Feature Extraction

`extract_features.py` splits a dataset into training and evaluation
subsets (80/20 by default) and saves each model's embeddings to separate
files:

```bash
python extract_features.py /path/to/images out_dir --device cuda:0
```

This command produces `MODEL_train_features.pth` and
`MODEL_eval_features.pth` for every model in the internal model zoo.
